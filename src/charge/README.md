# Introduction to the Fast Charging Board

## What is a Fast Charging Board?
The charging board can convert low-voltage batteries into high-voltage output for use by amplifier boards.
::: caution
Not compatible with ex401 amplifier boards and pre-boards
:::

## Technical Specifications

- **Input Voltage Range**: 5V - 20V
- **Output Voltage Range**: 7.4V - 21V
::: info
The battery voltage can be adjusted via a variable voltage switch. If the maximum voltage is not reached, it may be due to insufficient battery charge.
:::
- **Maximum Output Power**: 30W
- **Supported Series Cell Count**: 2-5 cells
- **Protection Features**: Overcharge, over-discharge, overheating, and short-circuit protection

## Usage Instructions

1. Connect the battery in series with the power input of the amplifier board.
2. Connect the expansion interface to the expansion interface (tail plug interface) on the amplifier board.
3. Connect the charging interface (a standard Type-C power charger).

## Precautions

- Ensure that the input voltage is within the supported range of the charging board.
- Avoid using the device in extreme temperatures to prevent performance degradation and safety risks.
